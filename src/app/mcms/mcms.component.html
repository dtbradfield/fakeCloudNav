          <h3>The IAM Cloud Advantage</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>Another advantage is if you decide to use IAM Cloud, an Azure-based service for identity and access
            management (which eliminates the need for on-premises ADFS or DirSync), we will leverage IAM Cloud to
            provision users for the migration. In addition, IAM Cloud provides the following ongoing benefits: Single
            Sign-on from any directory, or even through your web portal, to any standards based application; business
            continuity for SaaS, unlike other solutions if your directory is unavailable for whatever reason, people are
            still able to authenticate to their online apps from any location with internet access; password management;
            Office 365 license management; cloud-hosted identity store for CSPs and OEMs; true SAML 2.0 Federation, and
            alumni identity hosting.</p>
